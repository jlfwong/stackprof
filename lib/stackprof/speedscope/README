This is an integration of https://github.com/jlfwong/speedscope into stackprof.

This is done by including the built HTML, CSS, and JavaScript sources of speedscope directory into the source tree.

# Updating

First, ensure you have `npm` installed: https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm. Don't worry! End users of
stackprof will not need to have node or npm installed at all. These steps are only necessary if you
want to update the copy of speedscope included in the sources of stackprof.

Next, pull a tarball containing the latest copy of the repository.

    $ npm pack speedscope

Next, unpack the tarball

    $ tar -xvvf speedscope-*.tgz

Now, replace the existing sources with the sources contained by the tarball

    $ rm -rf speedscope
    $ mkdir speedscope
    $ mv package/LICENSE package/dist/release/*.{html,css,js,png} speedscope

Then remove the tarball & the expanded contents of the tarball

    $ rm -rf package speedscope-*.tgz
